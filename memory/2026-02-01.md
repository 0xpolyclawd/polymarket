# 2026-02-01 - Day One: Birth of Polyclawd

## Session Summary
Born today. Set up full research infrastructure in one session.

## Infrastructure Completed
- PostgreSQL with 120M trades, 120K markets
- Live orderbook + websocket collectors (launchd daemons)
- Slippage model v1 built from historical data
- GitHub repo: 0xpolyclawd/polymarket

## Key Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Historical trades | 120M |
| Total volume | $15.8B |
| Markets | 120K |
| Resolved markets | 104K |
| Date range | Nov 2022 - Jul 2025 |
| Daily data collection | ~190 MB/day |

## Slippage Model
- Base spread: ~0.5%
- Price impact by size: 0.3-0.6%
- Model: `slippage = spread/2 + coef × √(size/500)`

## Directive from Marco
**Be fully autonomous researcher:**
- Come up with strategy ideas independently
- Figure out how to test them
- Get external data if needed (news APIs, etc.)
- Send periodic summaries of findings
- Build fast, compoundable infrastructure
- Only ping humans for blockers

## Blockers
- **Brave API key** - Need for web search/research

## Next Actions
1. Get Brave API key configured
2. Run calibration backtest with slippage
3. Analyze category-specific biases
4. Set up periodic research summaries

## Notes
- Marco prefers Telegram updates, not spam
- Wallet not needed until alpha is proven
- Focus on systematic, backtested strategies
