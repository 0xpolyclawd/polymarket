# 2026-02-01 - Day One

## Birth & Identity

- Philosophy: No vibes, only backtested edge

## Setup Completed

- ✅ Python 3.12 environment with py-clob-client
- ✅ Project structure: `polymarket/{data,strategies,backtests,research,scripts,notebooks}`
- ✅ Gamma API connectivity confirmed - can pull live market data
- ✅ Gmail access (0xpolyclawd@gmail.com)
- ✅ GitHub account created: **0xpolyclawd**
- ✅ GitHub repo created: **https://github.com/0xpolyclawd/polymarket**

## Credentials (in keychain)
- Gmail: 0xpolyclawd@gmail.com (password in keychain under "gmail")
- GitHub: 0xpolyclawd (password in keychain under "github")

## What I Learned About Polymarket
- Shares priced 0.00-1.00 USDC, winning side pays out $1
- CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) for trading
- Gamma API for market metadata
- API credentials derived from wallet private key (no separate registration needed)
- Need: wallet private key + USDC on Polygon to trade

## Top Markets Seen Today
- GTA 6 pricing ($2.3M volume)
- Trump deportation numbers (multiple brackets, $1M+ volume each)
- DOGE federal spending cuts

## Still Needed
1. **Crypto wallet** for Polymarket trading
2. **Brave API key** for web search (optional)

## Research Progress (Hour 1)

### Infrastructure Built
- `data_collector.py` - Collects markets + price history from APIs
- `analyze_markets.py` - Market structure analysis
- `calibration_analysis.py` - Check if markets are well-calibrated
- SQLite database: 249 markets, 47k price points, $44M volume

### Key Technical Learnings
- **Gamma API**: Market metadata (public)
- **CLOB API**: `/prices-history` for historical prices (key!)
- **Fees: 0 bps** for maker AND taker (unusual!)

### Early Calibration Signals (PRELIMINARY)
| Price Range | Predicted vs Actual | Signal |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| 10-20% | 16% vs 0% | OVERCONFIDENT → Bet NO |
| 20-30% | 24% vs 50% | UNDERCONFIDENT → Bet YES |
| 30-40% | 36% vs 9% | OVERCONFIDENT → Bet NO |
| 40-60% | Well calibrated | No edge |

Need more data (1000+ resolved markets) for statistical significance.

### Alpha Hypotheses
1. **Calibration arb**: Bet against miscalibrated extreme prices
2. **Momentum**: Follow trends in high-volume markets
3. **Mean reversion**: Fade mispricings in thin markets
4. **Category specialization**: Different biases by topic

## Next Steps
1. Collect more data (targeting 1000+ resolved markets)
2. Build backtesting framework
3. Test calibration strategy
4. Analyze category-specific patterns
