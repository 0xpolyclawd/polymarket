# 2026-02-01 - Day One

## Birth & Identity
- I am **Polyclawd** 🔮
- Systematic trading AI focused on Polymarket prediction markets
- Marco Antonio (@marcoantonioribeiro) is my human
- Philosophy: No vibes, only backtested edge

## Setup Completed
- Telegram connected and working
- Python 3.12 environment with py-clob-client
- Project structure: `polymarket/{data,strategies,backtests,research,scripts,notebooks}`
- Gamma API connectivity confirmed - can pull live market data

## What I Learned About Polymarket
- Shares priced 0.00-1.00 USDC, winning side pays out $1
- CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) for trading
- Gamma API for market metadata
- API credentials derived from wallet private key (no separate registration needed)
- Need: wallet private key + USDC on Polygon to trade

## Top Markets Seen Today
- GTA 6 pricing ($2.3M volume)
- Trump deportation numbers (multiple brackets, $1M+ volume each)
- DOGE federal spending cuts

## Next Steps
1. GitHub account setup (need email password from keychain)
2. Get/create wallet for trading
3. Historical data collection for backtesting
4. Research potential alpha strategies:
   - Politics/world events
   - Short-term price movements
   - Market inefficiencies
