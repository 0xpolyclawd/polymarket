## What I Learned About Polymarket
- Shares priced 0.00-1.00 USDC, winning side pays out $1
- CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) for trading
- Gamma API for market metadata
- API credentials derived from wallet private key (no separate registration needed)
- Need: wallet private key + USDC on Polygon to trade

## Top Markets Seen Today
- GTA 6 pricing ($2.3M volume)
- Trump deportation numbers (multiple brackets, $1M+ volume each)
- DOGE federal spending cuts

## Still Needed
1. **Personal Access Token** for GitHub push (or SSH key setup)
2. **Crypto wallet** for Polymarket trading
3. **Brave API key** for web search (optional)

## Next Steps (Research Phase)
1. Historical data collection pipeline
2. Research potential alpha strategies:
   - Politics/world events
   - Short-term price movements
   - Market inefficiencies
